# memo-card-game
Simple memory-card game written on simple Javascript =) You either love it or you hate it!

User can pick the level to start from and the card jacket.

The time gets increased by 30 seconds every time you successfully pass the level!

The game is of course not perfect, it was written with the JS-knowledge i had at the time.

It is optimized for the computer and tablet screens.
